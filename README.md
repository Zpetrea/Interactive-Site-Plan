# Interactive Site Plan

An interactive app to view a site's floor plan and display exterior and interior images of doors by clicking on the corresponding door numbers.

(This interaction is an easy and cost-effective alternative to more advanced Matterport solutions, where the user wants an aerial view of a space 
and the ability to interactively view the space up close to showcase important figures/areas. The purpose of this project was to provide a quick and efficient way for vendors and stakeholders to view the site, understand the number of exterior doors that needed to be replaced, and provide the current condition/hardware for each door's exterior/interior. This also assisted with the alarm system upgrade by mapping each exterior door, its location, and its alarm code ID.)
