# Interactive Site Plan

An interactive app to view a site's floor plan and display exterior and interior images of doors by clicking on the corresponding door numbers.

(This interaction is an easy and cost-effective alternative to more advanced Matterport solutions, where the user wants an aerial view of a space 
and the ability to interactively view the space up close to showcase important figures/areas.)
